The "Car Rental Management System" is a user-friendly application designed to facilitate car rentals. This system has been developed using Python as the programming language and MySQL to handle the database. Its primary purpose is to provide an effortless and efficient experience for customers looking to rent cars.

Within this project, users are able to input their preferred car company and model. Once this information is provided, the system calculates the total cost for the specified rental duration. The data, including user details and rental information, is then securely stored in an SQL database, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the stored data.

One notable aspect of this project is its intuitive and engaging user interface. The user interface has been thoughtfully designed to make the rental process as straightforward as possible, allowing customers to easily navigate and select their desired car options.

In summary, the "Car Rental Management System" is a robust and user-friendly application that streamlines the car rental process. It empowers users to select their preferred vehicles, calculates costs accurately, and ensures the security of their data through secure database management. The intuitive user interface further enhances the overall rental experience.
